# Description:
Squid Game is a super popular Netflix show about important stuff like fairness and greed. People worldwide love talking about it online, making it a big cultural deal. Utilizing Natural Language Processing NLP and Python libraries,  in this project assess social media posts to identify whether sentiments are positive, negative, or neutral. Sentiment analysis aims to offer valuable insights into the future themes, cultural impact, and success of the show.

The Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) is a platform used for building Python programs that work with human language data for applying in statistical natural language processing (NLP). It contains text processing libraries for tokenization, parsing, classification, stemming, tagging and semantic reasoning.

A regular expression (or RE) specifies a set of strings that matches it; the functions in this module let you check if a particular string matches a given regular expression (or if a given regular expression matches a particular string, which comes down to the same thing).

Python libraries like matplotlib and wordcloud can be used to create word clouds. It's often used for visualizing and gaining insights from text data, such as identifying key terms in a document, website, or social media content.
